# Jpeg and Png Compressor

## Usage

1. Copy image files to `originals` directory.
2. Run `python tinyjpg.py`
3. Compressed images will be saved, with the same name, to `compressed` directory.
4. Run `./calculated_saved` to run a tool for outputting the percent reduction in file size before and after compression.

*Note: This currently only works for `.jpg` and `.png` files, as the api from TinyJPG/TinyPNG only works for those file types at this time.*
